# Get the charge for the food from the user
food_charge = float(input("Enter the charge for the food: "))

# Calculate the tip (18% of the food charge)
tip = food_charge * 0.18

# Calculate the sales tax (7% of the food charge)
tax = food_charge * 0.07

# Calculate the total amount
total_amount = food_charge + tip + tax

# Display the amounts
