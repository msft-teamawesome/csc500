### Part 1: Baseball Batting Averages Calculation

**Pseudocode:**
1. Ask the user for the number of years.
2. Initialize variables to store the total number of months and total batting average.
3. Use an outer loop to iterate over each year.
4. Inside the outer loop, use an inner loop to iterate over each month.
5. For each month, ask the user for the batting average and add it to the total batting average.
6. After all iterations, calculate the average batting average per month.
7. Display the total number of months, total batting average, and average batting average per month.
